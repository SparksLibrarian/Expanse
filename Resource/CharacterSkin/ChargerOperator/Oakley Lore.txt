That damn Golden Spark just had to go and die, didn't he?
We heard word of some edgy black flyin' fuck Distortion called Dark Shepherd, tearin' up M-Corp's Nest. Ain't it M's job to deal wit shit like that in their own Nest? But instead we were commissioned to take care of it. They'd've prolly commissioned Spark's to do it, since they've got a Color 'n all... If the thing didn't explode in some big blue fuckoff fireball a month an' a half back.
Y'see, when a big Corporation like M asks ya to do somethin', there's... They might ask ya, but there really ain't no choice but to do what they ask ya. So it's more like they're tellin' ya. I mean, you really gonna turn down a commission from some big ol' Corporation? I kinda couldn't. They paid me upfront an' ghosted me when I tried to tell 'em my Office can't handle somethin' like that. You heard the DDR on the radio. Homegirl Moses said that bitch was a Star of the City. Bet Spark coulda handled it. But, uhh... We couldn't. Luckily, I had me an invite to the Library as a get outta jail free card in case it turned out we really were fucked against that Dark Shepherd. And whoop dee doo, yes we were. So I signed it, an' had the boys sign it, and off we were.

Turns out it wasn't all that "get outta jail" of a get-outta-jail-free card.

It was like leapin' out of a fryin' pan and right into the fire.

Here's to hopin' somebody back at the Office will pick up on the fact that I ain't comin' back, and they'll take care of Buck for me. Buck, bein' my pet rat. I love the lil' bastard, you know.
