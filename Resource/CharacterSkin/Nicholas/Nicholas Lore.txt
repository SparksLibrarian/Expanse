Rosa...
I bet you feel so much better, now that I'm gone forever. I tell myself that I don't miss you, but that's a lie. It's been decades since I last saw you, Rosa. My foolish, boyish, impulsive love for you has faded, but I would be lying if I said all of it was gone. I've become a better man. But you can't see that now, can you? You'll never get to see it. "Sorry" can't excuse what I said and did. But it's all I can offer you now.

And now, I'm stuck in this accursed Library. Perhaps until the end of time.

Be honest. Lie not to me just to make me feel better; Are you glad that I disappeared?

Tell the others what I did, and what happened to me. Not because I'm proud of those things. They were far from achievements. I have no pride for how I ended up. Tell them so they know not to follow in my footsteps.
