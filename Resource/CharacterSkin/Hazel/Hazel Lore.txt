”Kelsey? It’s me, Alcmene. I know you’ve been struggling. I hate to see you struggle. Nobody to help you, struggling to make ends meet, and you don’t want to give up on [REDACTED]. I get it. You’re desperate, and you want a way out. I wish there was some alternative, but… If desperate times call for desperate measures… I can pull a few strings for you. Moonlight Corporation and Maple Workshop have developed something new, something powerful. If you’re willing… I could make you one of the first beta testers. If it works, it could rocket you up to Color status, and money would mean your problems are over. So… Think about it. Call me back when you have an answer. I still love you, Kells. Alcmene signing out. … Heheh… Just like old times..."



Not gonna lie, I miss my time in Amber Office. Half the reason I took up Alcmene's offer was hoping I could see her again. I didn't... But the visit wasn't awful. Redwood and Ava were super polite and nice and patient and stuff, and the surgery was a success. I'm a Color now, just like Alcmene said... But I don't hold a candle to like, any of the other Colors... Plus, I'm... I can't stargaze anymore. I've started seeing really weird shapes on the moon and in the stars. Shapes that... I really, really, really don't like...

They remind me of how I fucked up. Hard.
